# Clippy configuration for strict linting
# This configuration enforces high code quality standards

# Lint groups to enable
# The following lints are considered too noisy or not applicable:
# - `clippy::missing_errors_doc` - Too verbose for internal code
# - `clippy::module_name_repetitions` - Common pattern in Rust

# Deny all clippy warnings by default
# Individual lints can be allowed in specific files if needed

# Cognitive complexity threshold (default is 25)
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 15

# Too many arguments threshold (default is 7)
too-many-arguments-threshold = 7

# Type complexity threshold (default is 250)
type-complexity-threshold = 200

# Single char binding names to allow (default is [])
single-char-binding-names-threshold = 4

# Maximum allowed size for a line of code (soft limit)
# This is a guideline, not enforced by clippy
max-fn-params-bools = 3

# Disallow comparing to empty strings
# Prefer using .is_empty() instead
